Assumption of Importance,"Yeah, I mean, for Chinatown, I believe it is if you find that area or district. And that's important. So, you know, I think it's important because, like, I love going to Chinatowns in different cities. And I've always noticed, they're that they're very clearly defined to businesses and sometimes a little architecture from, you know, when once you go into the tarsal street, you enter an area and which makes it very significant more or less, you know, culturally significant ","Yes. Well, I think it represents the connection with early Chinese immigrants in Hawaii. And Chinese immigrants were some of the very first to arrive to into Hawaii. And there are out there, there are quite a few very old Hawaiian Chinese families in Hawaii. It also represents kind of a example of how Hawaii really celebrate multiculturalism. And although not perfect, is a good example. I think there are some really great examples for the world really, of how you can integrate a native culture with and how Native culture can then embrace and try to take the best of outside cultures and bring them together.",[had not started the recorder],"Yes, I do agree. From the structures of the roof, it kind of like resembles like, temples. The I think the architecture is pretty like intricate.

I guess I'm also an educator and cultural practitioner, I say I guess, because I'm basically a little bit of whatever I need to be in a time. And I do a lot of community murals. So I believe that when artists doing a mural by themselves is okay. But if you get a community investment in a mural, you also there's a lot of benefits that come out of it. For the participants. It's a sense of ownership that says connection and agency and for the community, they get, the community gets a chance to see that there is people who are there who care about a place and it's it creates kind of an example for how we need more, more commons. We need more places that are cared for by communities, and not just an entities or, you know, corporations.","My name is XXXXX XXXXX. I'm the chairman of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. We have over XXXXX locations all over United States and the world. And I was brought up close to Chinatown. So I spent a lot of time in Chinatown, so I know the area very well. So you know, recently I'm working on a project called the Chinatown arch, which is on Keiko Leakey Mall. So, you know, I, you know, since being brought up in Chinatown. I like to keep that to be a safe and clean place.",Okay. My name is XXXXX XXXXX. And I been asked to participate in this project because I've grown up around Chinatown.

I'm, I think the reason you invited me to participate in this interview is that I'm a scholar, scholar in Chinese studies. And also, I have this kind of cultural background of, you know, the cultural studies of China and the United States. Also, I have kind of the teaching experiences of like, the Chinese language. And also I always visit Chinatown to do grocery shopping.   [how often do you go to Chinatown?]  Um, you know, during the semester, usually, I go to Chinatown. Every weekend, almost. Yeah. Because groceries are much cheaper there.  [to get groceries and eat some food]",Self-Introduction
Relationship to Wo Fat,"my experience I have, I've never been inside of the Wo Fat Building, I've always seen it, and like I grew up in Hawaii, and I also grew up right off the road, I used to...I like to XXXXX elementary for a little bit of time, which is not far in this in this area. I as a child, I'd play on the Nu'uanu river a little more up stream from from this River Street area. But it feeds the River Street area, and I'd uh, catch crawfish and play and hang out with friends and my my brothers and sisters. And then we'd also come down to River Street as kid with nothing else to do and just kind of have a bamboo pole and just throw it in the water. We never caught anything. But just something to do more or less. And I've always noticed, it's more subconsciously, you're not as a child, you're just in your own world. But when you reflect back, you see certainty or you remember things things that bring a sense of almost nostalgia come from some type of connection. Right. And I guess that's what it kind of is, even though it wasn't as nice as it is now. It was still there, on my peripherals, you know, and it's, I don't know, he's just familiarity with within area, you know.","sure. Well, I know it maybe not particularly that building per se. I mean, yes, Wo Fat but probably all of Chinatown and the hope and basically, yeah, it's basically Wo Fat's a real hub for Chinatown. My family, we grew up on the west coast of Hawaii, on Oahu, in XXXXX area and whatever Auntie's or family would come to visit us, they would always bring something from Chinatown, it was always like, dim sum, you know, manapua. And so I have very early memories of going to Honolulu and going to the Chinatown area. And I believe one of the first places we ate Chinese food was at or at a fancy restaurant was one of the few restaurants that were in Wo Fat itself. The building, I can't remember things that specifically but yeah, it really it really served to be a hub for for Chinatown, and I think that's something that why I think it's quite still quite significant.","No, I have no relationship. Except, you know, I know people that owns it.","I do remember, when I was younger, I would go to some of the shops on the bottom floor. We would, there was this one shop. It was like a grocery shop. And I would always ask my mom to buy this one specific drink from there.",,Relationship to Wo Fat
Relationship to Chinatown,[already touched on above],"Yeah. Yeah. So and that, you know, in a sense, I think it's, it's this understanding that China calm represents Hawaii's first major connection with multiculturalism, your example of multiculturalism.",[see self intro],"So when I was younger, I would always go with my mom to grocery shop there. Um, she would push me around in the stroller, and we would visit all these different shops. She would buy, like vegetables, a lot of fish. And even nowadays, I would walk through Chinatown to catch the bus there. So yeah, I've just grown around like Chinatown, and I still live around there.

It could be a cameo, but I don't know. Like it's everybody who does these tag style things have their own different flavor or twist on every single alphabet. So the last letter could be something else. It's clear that the AME the middle error, the AME maybe there's another something else going on between the a and the m. That's a possibility, but","Yeah, I cannot read that. Absolutely not. And I definitely want to offer immediately I guess it's probably going to be a blanket statement. I struggle with tagging a lot. I ultimately would love to invite those taggers to be part of community murals. I don't know how to do that yet. It makes me very upset when community art is tagged, I see here and actually, I'm glad they at least didn't tag the mural itself. So that was really important. They tagged above it, which is not, it's never awesome. Art should never be criminalized, but artists shouldn't be criminals. If they aren't going to tag anything, tag a bank, tag McDonald's tag people who can afford to remove their tags. Don't tag community places, don't tag mom and pop stores. Yeah, so that's my blanket statement when it comes to tagging. I have I it's a it's it's right where I want to be as far as how do I engage with them so that they do not need to destroy. Because that's effectively what they're doing there, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to orchestrate community art. And that is it's, it's this idea, instead of you should ask. to do art, you should ask, you'd be surprised that people may invite you to come do art even better, be asked. Make yourself presentable and make people say, Oh, we want to include your art in our space and stuff. But that might be missing the point. Because I cannot possibly guess what their motivation is for writing their name on the wall. And they're probably very sad somehow and not and feeling the need for attention. And but that even that is oversimplifying? Very much. So","It looks like a graffiti, is that a graffiti?  ","No, I cannot read that.",It is hard.

They go on holiday, like they don't even understand it may it may seem like a form of rebellion, but maybe they just want to stand out in whatever it is everybody wants to be identified some way or have some form of recognition and it's a it's it's something obviously, they don't go around telling everybody but within their circle, the uh somebody's going to recognize it right?

And you everywhere there there's all these things and it's a super nice place well thought out no crime no except whatever that is. But it's not really considered crime it's just everywhere nobody even covers it up it stays there it's part of the architecture part of the the community part of the uh... you know like, and it's weird because these things are are everywhere there, they're aged or new and it's uh.  There's no homelessness there's no crime there's no foul things so that's when I started to look at these things. Copenhagen Denmark yeah yeah very very interesting there's it's kind of cool in I think in the event like France the same thing I don't know the crime there but it's very easy to see a place has literally no crime. Homelessness, very little that are not visible. I mean, sure, there is forms of that but they have a housing for them. The government takes care of it. You have drug use, but they have places to use drugs but you don't see it. It stays where it's more controlled, I guess and not just a wild west type of, because they're going to do it anyways.

It's not necessarily going to be the most technically perfect mural. It was because we only had very limited time. Very limited budget. I think I, I basically donated my time to do this. Because I think I only said, I just give me a couple hundred dollars is fine. And they paid for all the other supplies and everything like that. So yeah, I basically I ended up getting a $75 fine for parking in the wrong place. So I was like, Oh, well, there goes. There it goes half of my payment, this mural, which is fine. But I believe it was successful based upon the parameters that we had. It was also successful, because I think we got close to about 25 to 30 students were able to make it on that day. And it would have been more of a challenge if we had had to do multiple days because we would have to do multiple setups and, you know, setting up quick drop cloths, bringing down the paints and supplies, getting everything ready. getting as much done getting it to be done enough on one day, I think meant it was a pretty successful mural.","oh, I think it's very successful, I have a lot of people, you know, telling me, you know, it was great, [particularyl inclusion of Chinese characters?]  Yeah, that's the, you know, that's part of China, Chinatown.

I see patterns in not just here, but elsewhere, where places will tend to get rundown and then that place see like a New York and ??? area they, you know, you wait for sometimes you want people with money, or developers want a place to get rundown, it has a history, they'll let it go bad and then they'll come in and put some money in it or they might let it get worse.
